## 🧑‍💻 Step 3: Build Real-World Projects

### 🌐 **Project: Full DevOps Pipeline for a Web App**

| Tool        | Purpose                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **Terraform** | Provision AWS resources (EC2, S3, IAM) |
| **Jenkins** | Setup CI/CD pipeline        |
| **Docker**   | Containerize your web app   |
| **Kubernetes** | Deploy containerized app   |
| **Prometheus & Grafana** | Monitoring + Dashboards |

#### 🛠️ Project Setup Steps
1. Use **Terraform** to provision an EC2 instance.
2. Install **Jenkins** and configure a CI/CD pipeline.
3. Containerize a sample app (Node.js, Python, etc.) with **Docker**.
4. Deploy to a **Kubernetes cluster** (Use Minikube or EKS).
5. Monitor app using **Prometheus + Grafana** stack.
